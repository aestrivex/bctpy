==PACKAGES USED==
BCT python is light on packages. It requires numpy. Scipy is required for use
with some functions for its linear algebra computations.

==ABOUT BCTPY AND OTHER AUTHORS==
BCT is a matlab toolbox with many graph theoretical measures off of which bctpy
is based.  I did not write BCT (apart from small bugfixes I have submitted).  
With few exceptions, bctpy is a direct translation of matlab code to python.

bctpy should be considered beta software, with BCT being the gold standard by 
comparison. I did my best to test all functionality in bctpy, but much of it is
arcane math that flies over the head of this humble programmer. There *are* 
bugs lurking in bctpy, the question is not whether but how many. If you locate 
bugs, please submit them to me at rlaplant@nmr.mgh.harvard.edu.

Sporns and Mika Rubinov.
